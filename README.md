# DataVisualizationProject

Created for an assignment of the datascience minor to answer a few questions proposed by the teacher based on data extracted from Kaggle:
  What genres are making the most money? (Estimated gross per genre tab)
  What genres get the best ratings? (Estimated score per genre tab)
  How does this change over the years? (Estimated score/gross per genre over the decades tabs)

Warning: the UI is not very intuitive because this was not a focal point of the assignment.
